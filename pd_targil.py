# Create three Pandas DataFrames, each representing the car inventory of
# three different dealerships (A, B, C). Each dealership should have at least five
# different car models on hand, along with the corresponding amount in stock.
# For example - Dealership A â†’ Has 5 units of Ford Mustang GT in-stock
# 2. Write a Python function that gets a list of cars to buy and for each car check
# where the available dealerships that are selling this car and have it in stock.
# Your function should return for each car a list of the available dealerships and
# decrease the amount in stock for the relevant dealerships.

# * In case there are more than 1 available dealership that sell the requested
# car decrease the stock amount for only one of the available dealerships
